        <h1>Director’s Vision</h1>
        <h2>Abhishek Jain</h2>
        <h3>B.Tech, IIT Delhi | NTSE Scholar</h3>
        <p><span>Why domain E </span>- In around 2006 Kota still had students coming and competent teachers to coach
            them for
            Competitive Examination but there was no professional system for providing Board Exam Preparation as many
            students were facing problems due to that and hence domain E.</p>
        <p><span>Pre domain E </span>Prior to domain E, Mr Abhishek Jain has led the Institute domain IIT JEE, in Indore
            which carved
            a path for adopting the Kota system successfully outside Kota. The Institute then helped the many students
            achieve selection in IITJEE, alongwith rank in first 100 in IIT, which was a rarity outside institutes of
            Kota especially in Indore. This particular success was based on the Team which was competent and
            committed</p>
        <p>Later on due to some stroke of successive misfortunes the team received blows and the glory of domain IITJEE
            withered. Once again the Team and concept is back in action only this time the reach is much bigger with the
            Use of Technology.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-9 col-lg-9 col-xl-9">
                <p>The pattern of examination and competitions has much changed since inception of domain E. Today the
                    students are flocking in numbers but many find a lack of professional approach towards the average
                    and above average students. Hence Once again the Team is back with a newly designed course structure
                    which take care of all the students and ensures everybody gets his ability and money’s. We believe
                    in 5 years most of the coachings would be following new coaching structure</p>
