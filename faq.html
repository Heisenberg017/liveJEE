        1. What is the focus of LiveJEE?
    </div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        LiveJEE is about helping the student master in their subject for cracking the ITTJEE examination. We would be
        taking classes, tests and helping the student clear their doubts so that they are able to feel confident in the
        subject. Live CBSE is the platform which is focused to ensure your success by bringing best tutors and most
        authentic study material to your home.

        2. Are the classes Live or Recorded?
    </div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        The Lectures and Doubt Removal Sessions provided under this system will be LIVE and not recorded. The Recorded
        Lectures, we feel, miss the element of mentoring, discipline and handholding which is the essence of teaching.
        We have been successful in incorporating all the elements of classroom teaching in our system. This makes the
        learning experience not only equivalent but we dare say; better; as it makes our competent teachers omnipresent.

        3. How a student will enter into the class?
    </div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        For demo class, the student will receive a link on his mail id, through which he/she can join the demo classes.
        After that whatever teacher will write on board will appear on your computer screen and you can speak directly
        through voice after entering into the class. For regular classes after admission, you can login through your
        student account provided by us.

        8. What will happen if I miss a Live Class?
    </div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        Every class students are taking live will also be recorded for future reference, so that they can revise each
        and every topic again at any point of time. This will help to brush up the concepts at the time of exams. If a
        student misses any class then also he will get recorded lecture, and doubts can be asked in future live classes
        any time.
